 * Build A Pendant: http://lakenney.com/build-a-pendant/charms.html
 *
 * Created by Lucille Kenney
 * These are the techniques I covered:
 *  ◦ DOM traversal
 *  ◦ DOM element creation, deletion or modification
 *  ◦ AJAX
 *  ◦ Creating and handling a data structure (JSON, custom objects, etc)
 *
 * This file should be viewed with a server for the AJAX JSON request to get the price of silver.
 * The chains select feature was added but will need further development.
 * Some of these functions were borrowed from a previous project I had created a while back but that had nothing to do with the DOM, DOM traversal, JSON or AJAX): http://p4.lucillekenneyjewelry.com/pendants/build
